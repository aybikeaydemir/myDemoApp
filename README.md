In mathematics, a binary relation on a set A is a collection elements of A. In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A2 = A Ã— A. This application checks A's binary combinations.<br>
  In the first form,enter a list of integers separeted by a newline character.<br>
  In the second form,enter two integer.(We have two boxes for this )<br>
  If this two integers' combination are found in the list,it is a binary combinations,the result becomes true.<br><br>
